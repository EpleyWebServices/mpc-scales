# MPC Scales

**Midi note scale programs for legacy Akai MPC sequencers. A collection of .pgm files organized into useful musical categories.**

The scales are available for download at the [MPC Scales website](https://mpc-scales.macian.online/download).

The LITE version only includes the recognized (i.e. named) scales and doesn't include the "All" folder. This is the recommended package to use for most users.

The FULL version of the scales pack includes every possible 5 to 9 note scale _(including mode shifts)_ within the 12-tone equally-tempered system of music. The programs are organized into 5 octave directories which comes out to a total of 12,000 nested subdirectories and over 140,000 files in the system.

To test run the scales, head over to the [scales player](https://mpc-scales.macian.online/scales/ENJOY!) to see how the various scales are mapped to the MPC pads and banks. Record a sequence and switch the scales in real-time to get a sense of how the scales can be used on an actual MPC.
